# Strings and Arrays in C++
## Aim
We learn about strings and arrays in C++.
## Theory
In C++, a string is a sequence of characters stored in a `std::string` object, which provides a wide range of functions for manipulation. Arrays, on the other hand, are fixed-size collections of elements of the same type. 

For strings, you can use functions like `length()`, `substr()`, `find()`, and `append()`. You can also concatenate strings with the `+` operator and access individual characters with the `[]` operator.

For arrays, common operations include accessing elements with the `[]` operator, iterating with loops, and modifying elements directly. Arrays in C++ are of fixed size and donâ€™t have built-in functions like strings, so you often use loops or standard library functions to manage them.
